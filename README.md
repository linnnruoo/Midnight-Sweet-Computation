# Midnight-Sweet-Computation
Build-a-bot. Give it life. 
But nightmare to us.


## Getting Started

Please note that files and programs in this repository together with their descriptions are as follow:
1. `/Arduino/` - This folder contains the current working release of Arduino program
2. `/Pi/` - This folder contains the current working release of the Master Control program
3. `/debug/` - This folder contains the current debug build of the Arduino and Master Control programs
4. `/vanilla/` - This folder contains the vanilla build of the Arduino and Master Control programs
5. `/others/` - This folder contains miscellaneous programs that are used for testing purposes
6. `/final/ ` - This folder contains the finalized programs that were used for the demonstration and are submitted
    
For most part of this readme, the instructions based on the Master Control program in the /Arduino/ and /Pi/ folders.
